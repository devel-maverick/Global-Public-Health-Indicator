# Global Public Health Indicators – Analysis Project

The project examines global health trends through datasets on income levels, disease mortality, vaccination rates, healthcare spending, and development indicators.
The aim is to understand how social and economic factors influence health outcomes across countries and regions.

---

## Research Questions

1. **How strongly do income levels correlate with life expectancy and infant mortality across regions?**
2. **Which diseases contribute most to global mortality, and how does this differ between regions?**
3. **Are vaccination rates (measles, polio, COVID-19) linked to measurable declines in disease cases over time?**
4. **Do developing countries show faster improvements in health outcomes than developed ones, or is the gap widening?**
5. **How do healthcare spending and government policies explain variations in health outcomes?**

##  Project Summary

The notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and interpretation of global health indicators.  
It highlights long-term changes in life expectancy, disease burden, vaccination benefits, and how income and healthcare spending shape outcomes.

All analysis and graphs are included inside the Jupyter Notebook.
